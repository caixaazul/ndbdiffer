## Summary

Please provide a brief summary of your proposal. Two to three sentences is best here.

## Core Changes

Include a list of all Core changes, additions, subtractions as would be required by your proposal. These APIs should be considered placeholders, so the naming is not as important as getting the concepts correct. If possible you should include some "example" code of usage of your new Feature/Integration.

## Intended Use Case

Provide a detailed example of where your proposal would be used and for what purpose.
